# Rmd-Memo-Example
A research memo created in `R Markdown`

# Description
I created this research memo as a part of an assignment in my Spring 2023 Data Analysis course. I have since updated the assignment to reflect my growth in `R Markdown` as well as visualizations in `R`.

The research piece is meant to simulate a real-world exercise in which a client requests an update on COVID-19 county-level information. Our professor provided us with "messy" base code and two datasets in which we needed to compile a professional report.

The files in this repository include:
- `COVID19_Report.rmd` file 
- `index.html` file that shows the complete report
- `cdc vax mar1.csv` file for one of the initial datasets
